# CSCA 5622 Supervised Learning Final Project: Stellar Classification
### Project Overview

This repository contains the final project for the **CSCA 5622 Supervised Learning** course.

The primary goal of this project is to apply supervised machine learning techniques to a classification problem. Specifically, the project focuses on **Stellar Classification**, utilizing a dataset of astronomical observations to classify celestial objects (like **stars**, **galaxies**, and **quasars**).

The project includes:
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset's characteristics.
2.  **Model Analysis** and evaluation of various supervised learning algorithms.

### Project Structure

The core of the project is contained within a single Jupyter Notebook.

* `Stellar_Classification_Project.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all the data loading, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and performance analysis.
* (You may need to add a folder here for `data/` if the dataset is included in the repository.)

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

This project is built using Python. You will need a working Python environment (3.x) and the following libraries.

* `Python 3.x`
* `Jupyter Notebook` or `Jupyter Lab`
* **Standard ML Stack:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tejasphatak/CSCA-5622-Supervised-Learning-Final-Project.git
    cd CSCA-5622-Supervised-Learning-Final-Project
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

To replicate the analysis and view the results:

1.  Start the Jupyter Notebook server in the project directory:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Open the file `Stellar_Classification_Project.ipynb`.
3.  Run the cells sequentially to execute the EDA, train the classification models, and generate the final results and visualizations.

### Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
